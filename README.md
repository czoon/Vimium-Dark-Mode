**Note: This repository is archived since Vimium will have now [an official dark theme](https://github.com/philc/vimium/pull/3402). Currently I'm working in a [self adaptative theme](https://github.com/rcorzon/vimium/tree/chameleon-theme-prototype) that will allow Vimium to adapt it's color palette depending on the background color of the web page.**

# Vimium Dark Mode

A very simple dark mode to improve your Vimium experience while using some dark themed web.
